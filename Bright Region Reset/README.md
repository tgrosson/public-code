# Bright Region Reset

Grosson, T.; et al. "Bright Region Reset: an on-detector strategy for minimizing the impacts of atmospheric emission lines on spectral observations." *In prep.*

Select data products are provided in the `dataproducts/` directory. This includes final reduced spectra (`spectra/`), filter transmission spectra (`FTIR/`), and theoretical Ar and sky emission spectra.

**Main.ipynb**: Code for reducing raw FITS images to final spectra.

**Plots.ipynb**: Code for creating plots.

**reduce.py**: Code for working with data containing on-detector guide windows.
